# [JSL06] Submission: CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

In this coding challenge, I had to build a simple menu display system for a fictional UberEats restaurant called "CodeCuisine." The goal is to display different categories of food items and allow users to add items to their order with a click. In this challenge, I applied various JavaScript concepts, including functions and event handling to create an interactive menu.


## Tech Stack
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript

## Reflections
I had fun in this challenge and did not really have any major challenges. At some point, I only struggled with updating the total variable but solved the problem by declaring the totalPrice variable outside the functions.
